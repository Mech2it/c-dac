# Core Java

## Core Java- 19/5(Intro,Features,JDK/JRE )

### Features

* Simple
* Platform Independent
* High Performance
* Java is 100% object oriented everything is in class in c++ you can write main outside classs.
* java is compiled and intrepeted language.
* JIT(Just in Time) Compilier:-
  * work just before execuation.
  * It conver some part of code directly into machine understanding.
* because of this language become faster it avoid read and convert time.
* Security over the internet
* Robust(strong/tough)
  * Automatic Memory Management
  * Expection Handelling
* Multithearding(multitasking)
* Distributed(Remote Server involved)
* Dynamic

#### JDK/JRE

![JDK/JRE](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/2\_jdkjre.PNG)

#### First Program

```
	public class Hello
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			System.out.println("Hello world");
		}
	}
```

* When the class is decleared as public then the name of program should be class name..
* static method can called without object creation thats why used in main.
* `out` is the object called for print, `out` object is accessible using System class.
* `println()` is a method.
* At least one class should be public because of `main()`.
* Class name always should be start with capital.
* System=Class, out=object, println()=function.
* Setting path of java/javac(for setting epath of java and javac you need following steps.).

![setpath of java/javac](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/1\_setpath.PNG)

* for run program javac _programName_.
* javac -version is used to check the version of java.
*   \*Bytes code(.class) always based on class name,if program name and class name is not equal then .class file name will be class name not a program name. \*

    > javac _programName_

    > java _.classFileName_

## 20/5 (OOPs,Major and Minor piller)

### Introduction of Object Oriented Programming

**Procedural Programming**

```
* It made with the functions.
* Co-ordinate with `main()`.
* Not working with entity.
* Real life modelling is not possible.
* Data Security (primery focous on procedurse not security)
* After some code modification of code is difficult. 
```

* To overcome from this disadvantage they come up with new concept i.e OOP

#### Object Oriented Programming

**Object**

* It is instance of the class
* It representing real life entity- customer,student, account
* Object has some state and behavior.
* Every object has some _identity_ and _role_ to be play in system
* Some objects are actually physically present those are called as tangible entity/object.(eg. student, laptop,hard-disk)
* Some objects are not actually physically present those are called as non-tangible entity/object (eg. data, account,software)
* Object is something which present the real life tangiable non tangable entity which have some identity and role to be played.
* State and behavior of objects
  * Set of values given to the common attributes which are used for describing the object.
  * State is description of the object.
  * Eg. there is a car which has some compay name,color,number..etc
  * So if the object is `MyCar` then the state of the object are Maruti,Black,mh14p8254..etc
  * State is the description of object.
  * There is some functionality/behavior/role of object like car speed in program it is like function.
  * State= Set of values
  * Identity is one of the state value which has some unique identity. ![Object](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/3\_object.PNG) ![object](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/4\_repState-bev.PNG)

### Four Major Piller of OOP

#### Major Piller

1. Abstration
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphim

#### Minor Piller

1. Strong typing
2. Concurrency
3. Persistance

#### Minor Piller

**1) Strong Typing**

* Perticular type of input of way of typing or wiritng code.

**2) Concurrency**

* Simultaneous Execution eg. Notepad spelling check

**3) Persistance**

* Perment Storage/Database

#### Major Piller

**1) Abstraction**

* Selective ignorance
* It helps in reducing the complixity of code.
* Process of seperation which take what is needed.
* It focous on what is needed/required and discart everything else.

**2) Encapsulation**

* State(data) and Behavior(function) are inseparable thats why we use Encapsulation
* State and behavior will always together bundled into one unit is clalled Encapsulation.
* Advantage- 1.Data hiding/helps to restrict access of data
* 2.Data Binding
* 3.Complex functionlity can be hidden so that simple UI is used for use of object.
* 4.Hide Complixity and give simple functions to the user
* Class is the best example of encapsulation.

**3) Inheritance**

* Its about the "is a" relationship.
* If t entity having "is a" relationship then there is Inherantance.
* Adventage 1.Reusability/reusing of code.
* 2.It creates the basics of polymorphism
* Spealize entity from existing generalize entity by adding some extra state and behavior.

**4) Polymorphism**

* Polymorphism:- Same massage given to common entity of different object.(different function defication)
* Encaspulatio Unit

```java
class Date
{
	// state and beahvior 
	// data members(private) + member methods(public)
	private int dd;
	private int mm;
	private int yy; //state members 
	
	public void showDate()
	{
		System.out.println(dd+"/"+mm+"/"+yy);
	}
{

public class DateDemo
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		Date d1;		//Referance variable decleration
		d1 = new Date();	//object creation
		d1.shoowdate();
	}
}
```

## 21/5 (Data Types, Memory Management, Constructor, this)

#### Data Types

1. Value type (premative) int,char,short,double,float eg. char ch;
2. Referance type (referance/non-premative(in c/c++)) class,array,interface eg. Date d1; ![Data type tree](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/5\_dataType.PNG) ![Memory Management](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/7\_size.PNG) ![Memory Management](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/8\_operator.PNG)

### Memory Management in java

* main method variable is in stack.
* Object are stored in heap.
* `new` is going to create to object in heap
* heap data members(data in heap/object) are always initilize value 0.
* Default value of object variable is 0. ![Memory Management](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/6\_Memory.PNG)
* Garbage collector is actually removing the unreferancing objects from the heap.
* In java in switch case you can use int abd string also.
* One advanced for loop(each for) is added in java.
* Class(acts as encapsulation unit) never occupy any memory.

### Constructor

* Is the function have same name as class.
* If you dont write constructor there is default constractor(zero argument).
* It has no any return type.
* There is two type of constructor 1. parameterise 2.non-parameterise.
* If you dont write any constructor then the default will be there if the you pass with argumrent you have to write the cinstructor.
* If you write paramatrised constractor then the default is not avalible.
* We can write N number of constructor but parameter should be different. No constructor :- Default constructor call Constructor with parameter :- have to define parametrised constructor Both (para/non para) :- Both are avalible but parameter constructor have to define (eg. con(), con(int a, int b))
* Constructor follow all the rules of polymorphism.
* Constructor assign the local variable value to instance variable.
* which constructor will use is depends on creation of object.
* If you create a object of parameterised constructor then only parameterised constructor will call

#### this

* `this` is the referance is refering to the current object(for which constructor is called)
*   Refer last point of constructor.

    ```
      instance variable = local variable
      this.dd = dd;
      this.mm = mm;
      this.yyyy = yyyy;
    ```
* We are assigning the local variable to the instance variable.

## 22/5 (Garbage Collector, Array)

**revise**

![Revise](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/9\_revise.PNG)

#### Garbage Collector

* Static
* Static can access only static data
* Non static access both static and non static

**static block,static method,static variable**

**Static , Array covered portion**

* [Download and see code here](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/tree/main/Core%20Java/22-05)

## 24/05 (Association Relation, Wrapper Classes)

**Referance equality**

![Referance Equality](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/10\_referance_equ.png)

#### Association Relationship/has a relationship

* General rule of Encaplusation is declear _Data Member as private_ and method public.

```java
class Person
{
   private String name; //instance/non static-has
   private Date bdate;  //referance variable-has
   private int age;     // value type variable
   
   //person has name
   //person has birthday
   public Person(String name, int dd,int yy,int mm )
   {
   	this.name=name;
   	this.bdate=new Date(dd,yy,mm);
   }
}	
class Date
{
   	int dd,yy,mm;
   	public Date(int dd,int yy, int mm)
   	{
   		this.dd=dd;
   		this.mm=mm;
   		this.yy=yy
   	}
}

class PersonMain()
{
   public static void main(String args [])
   {
   	Person p1 = new Person("Shree",07,97,08);
   }

}
```

* One object inside/contain other object is called has relationship.
* Object within object.
* Instance of one class contain instance of another class is called has a relationship.
* Reusing the class
* If you do not assign any value to referance variable it will treat as null.
* name and bdate will be null if you dont assign anything to it.
* In Value type variable if you dont assign anything then it'll be zero.
* `int age` will be zero if you dont assign anything to it.
* you cannot call methoth on null referance you will get error called _null pointer expection_.
* Person is container and and bdate is component.
* Adventage:- reusability.

#### Object Array

```java
public class ObjectArray
{
	Date [] datearr;
	datearr = new Date[3];
	datearr[0]=new Date();
	datearr[1]=new Date(11,12,99);
	datearr[2]=new Date(12);
	
	// Short cut
	//Date[] datearr = {new Date(),new Date(11,12,99),new Date(22)};

for(int i=0;i<datearr.lenght;i++)
{
	datearr[i].showdate();
}
}
```

**Wrapper Class**

* Is the classes which is replaced to treditional variables for using 100% oops concepts.
* Example:-

```java
	int i=10;
	Integer obj = new Integer(23);
	Integer obj = i; //autoboxing feature-no need to write new  
	// obj is object
	//i is value
	int num = obj; //auto unboxing
```

* It assign object to integer(auto unboxing) and integer to object(auto boxing)
* Because of wrapper class java is pure object oriented.
* There are 8 premative data type so there is 8 wrapper classes.
* Specifically Wrapper classes used in collections.
* [Download and see code here](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/tree/main/Core%20Java/24-05)

## 25/05 (Packages,IDE)

#### Packages

* Packages is a namespace/collection of classes interfaces and sub-classes.
* Conceptually its a File Manager/File system in our mobile and PC.
* Easy to manage the things.
* File with same name but in different folder (avoid name conflicts).
* Example of build in package java.lang is base and java.io,java.util,java.sql are sub packages.
* You can create your own package.
* Package name always should start with small letter.
* To start package you have to just put `package package_name;`.
* Always start your program with package include.
* Sub packages are imported as `package package_name.sub_package;`
* When package is complied packages are reflected in folder hierarchy.
* Helps in reusability.
* Build in package java.lang API.

![Package APi](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/11\_package-api.png)

* Package name should be short and small letter.
* Command for package compile `javac -d dirpath javafilename`

#### Eclipse IDE

* It gives Development support
* Eclipse is developed in JAVA
* Plugin is avalible for extra features.
* Workspace is a current working directory that has to be selected when eclipse is started
* Perspective is combinition of views and editors that are required for a perticular type of application.
* Use `ctr+space` for auto complete.
* In project there is option `Build Automically` so thats why its compiling when you typing code.
* Right click on code then source then generate const from superclass for creating constructor/with field(parameterized) autumatically.

![Eclipse Code](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/12\_eclipse.png)

## 26/05(Inheritance,super(),Overriding, Dynamic Binding, Debug, Scanner)

#### Inheritance

* It has is a relationship.
* Creating specialized entity from existing generalized entity by adding extra state and behavior.
* Person- name and bdate is state -display()
* Emp- empid,salary bev - calSalary()
* `extends` is keyword for inheritance.

```java
	class Emp extends Person
	{
		//person is parent/super class
		//emp is child/sub class
	}
```

* It found is a relationship with each others.
* It used for reusability.
* Child class recive data members and methods.
* Private members are restricted within the class so not avalible for child.
* Super() is for accessing super class constructor.

![Super](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/13\_super.png)

* We can access any constructor with the help of super()
* super always should call first in subclass.
* super() is a representation on the default constructor of the super class.
* So if you dont write, it will defaultly call default constructor of super class.
* Two methods of same name can be same in super and sub class because they are not in same class this is called method overriding.

```java
	// Method overriding
	class Person
	{
		
		display();
	}
	
	class Emp extends Person
	{
		int id,salary;
		public void display()
		{
			super.display();
			syso("ID:-"+id);
			syso("Salary:-"+salary)
		}
	}
```

* Recrusion is calling same method from same method.

```java
	// Recursion
	class Emp extends Person
	{
		public void display()
		{
			display();
		}
	}
```

* The difference between Inheritance and the import in import you cannot access data members of class but in inheritance you can access the data members of super class.

**debug,scanner**

#### Scanner

![Scanner](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/14\_scanner.png)

#### Dynamic Binding

* Whenever you create referance of super class you can create object of subclass `Person p = new Emp();`

![create obj](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/15\_create-obj.png)

* If we call `p.display();` which display will call, to understand this we need to understand _static binding and dynamic binding_

**static binding (Not used in JAVA)**

* Binding takes place at compile time
* It is based on type of invoking entity
* It will resolve on type of `p`/Person.

**Dynmaic binding (used in java)**

* Binding takes place at run time.
* It resolve on type of object refered by invoking entity i.e object of `p`/Empolyee.
* All instance method calls are resolved dynamically so the display() called from empolyee.

```java
	// if you create referance of super class i.e Person p; (Person is super class)
	
	// You can create object of subclass i.e p=new Empolyee(); (Empolyee is subclass)
	
	// you cannot do Empolyee e = new Person();
	
	class Person 
	{
		display()
		{
			System.out.println("Person display");
		}
	}
	
	class Empolyee extends Person
	{
		dislay()
		{
			System.out.println("Empolyee display");
		}
	}
	
	pblic class MainClass
	{
		public static void main(String args)
		{
			//Now see the obj and referance 
			
			Person p = new Empolyee();
			p.display();
			
			// so the question is which display will call Empolyee-> display() or Person-> display();
			
			//java used Dynamic Binding so it called Empolyee display
		}
	}
	
	
```

```
> The output of the program 
> Empolyee display
```

## 27/5 (class objects, c-o overiding)

#### Class object

* Hierarchy of class object object -> class Person -> class Emp
* Super class of Person is object and in object following are the methods
*   Methods oof class Object

    > public String toString(); public boolean equals(); public void wait(); public int hashCode(); protected void finalize();
* By default this methods are present in every class that you create object.

```java
	p s v m(s [] a)
	{
		Person p = new Emp();
		System.out.println(p);  //p.toString()
		
		//Person class has received toString() from class Object
	}
```

* It will print hash map line `office.emps.Emp@262323a`

**Class object overiding**

```java
	// in Person class 
	@override
	public String toString()
	{
		return "Name: "+name+" Birdthdate:- " +bdate;
		
		//name.toString();  bdate.toString();
	}
```

* Output of this code is `Name:- shree Birdthday:- utility.Date@5215525a;`
* To avoid `utility.Date@5215525a;` on the place of birdthdate you need to write return toString() in Date class.
* If there is toString() is in Emp class then it will call Emp -> toString();
* In below code Emp class don't contain toString() but its super class contain the toString() so it call Person -> toString();
* And for birdthdate the flow is main -> Emp(not toString()) -> Person(super of Emp) -> toString -> Date -> toString();

![Class Object](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/16\_classobj.png)

* It represent object in string.
* It convert object to string.
* Purpose of toString() and display() are the same but toString print directly with the help of object.
* [Download and see code here](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/tree/main/Core%20Java/27-05)

## 28/5(Multilevel Inheritance,foreach, Abstraction, Access Specificer)

#### Multilevel Inheritance

![Class Object](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/17\_multilevel.png)

* The flow of Executing constructor is Person()->Empolyee()->SalesManager()

**foreach loop**

```java
	Emp [] allemps;
	allemps = new Empolyee[3];
	allemps[0] = new SalesManager();
	allemps[1] = new Admin();
	// Shortcut 
	Empolyee [] allemps = {new SalesManager(), new Admin()};
	
	for (int i=0;i<allemps.length;i++);
	
	// Advanced for loop foreach.
	for(Empolyee e : allemps) 
	{
		System.out.println(e); //e.toString;
	}
	
	// here we achive polymorphism sending same data to every method but every methods acts diffently 
```

* foreach is only used for array.
* Protected data members are accesssible to its sub classes
* If you dont write access specificer then the scope is package
* Thre is 4 access specifier public, private, protected and default
* keywords are 3 and specificers are 4.

![Access Specificers](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/18\_access-spe.png)

#### Abstraction

* Abstract methods that are not decleared in super class.
* Methods that are not decleared are used for polyprism.
* If one of the method in the class is decleared as abstract then class should be abstract.
* Subclass must to complete abstract method if it fail to complete the abstract method then the subclass will be abstract.
* creating instance of abstract class is not allow.
* we cannot create object of abstract
* non abstract classes are concrate class.
* non abstract classes can be decleared as abstract

![Abstract](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/19\_abstract.png)

* e.calsal(); will not call because it is not in Super class Emp.

![Abstract](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/20\_abstraction.png)

```java
public class Empolyee
{
	public void display()
	{
		System.out.println("Empolyee Display");
	}
	
	
	public void accept()
	{
		System.out.println("Empolyee accept");
	}
}

public class Manager extends Empolyee
{
	display();
	accept();
	calsal();
}

public class SalesPerson extends Empolyee
{
	display();
	accept();
	calsal();
	bonous();
}

public class WageEmp()
{
	display();
	accept();
	calsal();
}

public class MainClass()
{
	Empolyee e = new Manager();
	e.calSale(); //cannot be compile 
	
}
```

* In below code `e.calSale();` will not compile because It searches the function in super class i.e in Empolyee.
* That is why abstration concept comes in picture.
* So you can declear the method in super class but there is no need to declear that method.
* You cannot create object of abstract class.
* We cannot create object that's why we use array.
* [Download and see code here](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/tree/main/Core%20Java/28-05)

## 29/5(geter/seter,final,Interface)

#### geter/seter

* The rule says that class data members should be decleared as private.
* Because of this its unable to access in subclass.
* So there is 2 options to access that data member i.e 1. make it protected so it will accessable to sub class.
* And 2nd option is geter and seter methods.
* geter() method return private data member.
* seter() set new value to private data members.

```java
public class Account
{
	private String name;
	private int no;
}
public String getName()
{
	return name;
}

public String setName(String name)
{
	this.name = name;
	return name;
}

public int getNo()
{
	return no;
}
public int setNo(int no)
{
	this.no=no;
}
```

#### final

* final is the keyword in java.
* It is exactly opposite abstract.
* It cannot be modified/change.
* it is fully defined.
* It can be used in variable,methods and classes.
* final is replacement of const in java.
* We can only declear final but you have to initilize it afterwords.
* fianl variable decleared all in capital i.e final String NAME="shree"
* final Methods cannot be overriden.
* eg.class object methods wait(),notify(),notifyAll() are defined final.
* final classs cannot be modified
* String class in java library is decleared as final.
* Because you cannot modified final class, fianl class cannot acts as super class.

![final](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/21\_methods.PNG)

* final keyword for array.

![final](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/22\_finalarr.PNG)

#### Interfaces

* Interfaces are 100% incomplete.
* In interface there are abstract methods and concrete methods.
* In Inteface there is only final variable and abstract methods (for now)

![Interface](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/23\_interface.PNG)

* Multiple interheritance through the classes is not allow but using interface its allow.

![Interface](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/24\_interface1.PNG)

* Anything you write in interface it will default take `public static final`

```java
interface Drawable
{
	static double PI = 3.14; //public static and final
	double calArea(); //it can only decleared as public andabstract
	void drawShape(); //methods are bydefault treated as abstract
}

class Rectangle implements Drawable 
{
	privete double lenght,breadth;
	//constractor 
	// here toString method is avalible
	double calArea()
	{
		
	}
	void drawShape()
	{
		
	}	
}

class MainClass
{
	public static void main(String [] args)
	{
	Drawable d = new Circle();
	//interface referance = implementing class instance
	//super class referance = sub class instance
	d.calArea(); // Instance and non static methods resolve using dynamic binding
	//so it will call from the Circle class. 
	}	
}
```

* It has is a relationship.
* You cannot create a object but you can create a referance of interface.
* You can create only referance of Interface.
* There is no any concerete method in interface( upto java 1.7).
* Complesary you have to implement all the methods in sub class.

```java
interface A
{
	void m1();
}
interface B extends A
{
	void m2();
}
class X implements B
{
	void m1(){}
	void m2(){}
}
```

* If two interfaces are extend with each others (A and B)
* Then in implement class i.e (X) need to implement both interface methods.
* Class and Interface relation
  * class ---> (extends)---> class
  * class ---> (implements)---> interface
  * interface ---> (extends)---> interface
* Abstract class and Interface cannot create object.
* Make difference between class and Interface.

## 31/5(typecast, instanceof, interface of java8)

#### Types of methods

* Final Methods
  * Final methods are defined final it will not modified/override furtere
* Concrete Methods
  * In concrete methods we can override or not also.
* Abstract Methods
  * Abstract methods should be complesary override in subclass
* Default Methods
  * Default methods are decleared in inheritance onwards java8 as concrete methods in inheritance

#### How multiple inheritance replaced by interfaces

![Interface](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/25\_interface2.png)

* We can use extend and implement both on one class

```java
public class SalesManager extends Empolyee implement ITraveller
{
	//add all unimplemented methods in ITraveller 
	//ITraveller is interface so you have to implement all methods which in ITraveller
}
```

#### typecast

* Convert the type of variable/object
* double d=4.6; ---> float f=(float)d;

```java
	Empolyee [] allEmp;
	allEmp = new Empolyee[3];
	allEmp[0]=new SalesPerson("",,,,);
	allEmp[1]=new SalesPerson("",,,,);
	allEmp[2]=new SalesPerson("",,,,);
	for (Emp e : allEmp)
	{
		if(e instanceof ITreaveller)	//It checks e can be typecasted toITreaveller so remove error that is showed in typecast
		{
		System.out.println("TA:  "+((ITraveller)e).calculateTA());
		}
	}
```

#### instanceof and typecast

* instanceof is a operator

![Typecast error](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/26\_typecast.png)

* It return true and false value
* Referance below code and error ---> It checks e can be typecasted toITreaveller so remove error that is showed in typecast
*   syntax

    > e instanceof iTreaveller e source, ITreaveller is destination
* It avoid error in runtime
* It is intelligent way of checking typecast is valid or not
* upcasting is not required (super calss methods are avalible for subclass as it is)
* Downcast is required (because subclass methods are not avalible in super class)

![Typecast](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/27\_typecast1.png)

![Typecast](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/28\_typecast2.png)

* Extra ↓

![Typecast](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/30\_typecast4.png)

* It verified calsalary(); is avalible in person or not

#### Interface onwards java 8

* Previously interface only contain abstract methods
* If i go and suddenly add abstract method in interface will breakdown existing classes
* When this is realize by the oracal and other developers
* Now do not add suddenly any abstract method insted of that use default keyword
* Also you can add static method in interface
* Now there are three type of methods in interface
  * Static (not expect to rewrire or overide)
  * Abstract (compulsory override)
  * default (do or don't)

```java
interface A
{
	void m1();		// compulsory to implement
	default void m2()	// not compulsory use it or not 
	{}
	
	static void m3()
	{
	}

}
class MyClass implements A
{
	void m1(){}
	void m2(){}
}
```

* Interface can be implement across the hierarchy (Not abstract classes)
* Interface deside what to do
* Class decide how to do it ![Typecast](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/31\_interface.png)
* [Download and see code here](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/tree/main/Core%20Java/31-05)

## 1/6

#### Exception Handling

* Handling the error occured during run time
*   Ther is three type of error

    > Compilation logical run time
* Runtime errors are not under the control of the programmer.
* Java library many exception classes are already defined
* Exception object are thrown ![Typecast](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/32\_exception.png)
* Expection handling revolves around 5 keywords try catch finally and through

```java
public class ExpectionDemo
{
	public static void main(String [] args)
	{
		try
		{
			int n1= Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
			int n2= Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
			Syso("Division:"+(n1/n2));
		}
		catch(Expection e)
		{
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}
```

```
try-catch
try-catch-catch
try-finally
try-catch-catch-finally
```

#### Finally block

* Real purpose of finally block is not to handle expection.
* Even if there is no expection still finally block always get executed

## 8/7(Java IO, Stream)

#### Java IO(Input Output)

* Stream is a sequence of data which travelling from source to destination
* Stream are in `java.io` package
* Stream
  * byte Stream
  * Character Stream
    * String, char\[]

![Typecast](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/33\_IOstream.png)

* java io is based on 4 abstract classes
  * **Byte**
  * Input Stream
  * Output
  * **character**
  * Reader
  * Writer
* Three steps of every IOoperation should be follow
  * Open Stream
  * Use Stream
  * Close Stream
* printStream class contain print & println and out is object
* In some Stream classes Source and Destination is not defined
* eg.ObjectOutputStream
* to overcome this will use **object chaining**
* Two stream are together for performing some IO.
* FullIOoperation = IO Operation1 + IOoperation2
* FileOutputStream+ObjectOutputStream

```java
// Object chaining

Person p = new Person("shree",new DOB(7,8,97));
```

#### Consol IO

* Predefined Stream
  * System.in
  * System.out
  * System.err
* .err/.out/.in <-- are the Static datamembers of System class
* .out is object of printstrim class

#### BufferReader

* BufferReader is the character reader stream

![core java](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/blob/main/Core%20Java/Media/34\_IOstream.png)

* Some important functions of BufferReader
* br.read()
  * It return integer single char
  * int i = br.read();
* br.readLine()
  * It return String
  * String str = br.readLine();

```java
// Dummy/psudoCode
BufferReader br = new BufferReader(new inputStreamReader(System.in));   // OPEN STREAM
int n = br.read();							// USE STREAM
System.out.println((char)n);

_______________________________________________________________________

System.out.println("Enter 'q' for exit");
while((n=br.read()) != 'q')						// USE STREAM
{
	System.out.println((char)n);
}
br.close();								// CLOSE STREAM
```

```java
// Real Code
public static void main(String [] args)
{
	// ISR is passed for creating BR instance is object chaining
	BufferReader br=null;
	try
	{
	 br = new BufferReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
	
	syso("Enter q to quit");
	int n;
	
	while(n=br.read())!='q')
	{
		syso((char)n);
	}
	
	}catch(IOException e)
	{
		e.printStackTree();
	}finally
	{
		try{
		br.close();
		}catch{
		
		}
	}

}

```

* BufferReader return type is char so we need to parse a data as follow

**Parsing BufferReader**

```java
int sid = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
String name = br.readLine();
float marks = Float.parseFloat(br.readLine());
double percent = Double.parseDouble(br.readLine());
char ch = br.readLine().charAt(0);
```

#### File IO

**File Reader**

* Stream
  * FileInput -byte read
  * FileReader - char read
  * FileOutputStream - byte write
  * FileWriter - char write
* Creating Stream
* It need information of file
* We gave info as String path or file object
* File object contain metadata (the data about data)
  * file size, readable,extra path contain in metadata
* There is two way that we can pass the file to file stream
* one is direct path
* and another is File object

**File path**

```java
// direct path passing
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("path")
// File object
File f = new File("path");
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(f)
```

* The benifites of passing FileObject is we can use multiple functions in `File` like
  * f.length();
  * f.canRead();
  * f.isFile();
  * f.isDirectory();
  * f.lastModified();

```java
// File Reader	

FlieReader fr = new FileReader("path");
int n;
while((n=fr.read()) != -1)  // -1 is end of stream
{
	System.out.println((char)n);
	
}
fr.close();

```

**File Writer**

* Byte Stream

```java
// Byte Stream Program
public static void main(String [] args)
{
	String s = "github.com/shreeshailaya";
	FileOutputStream fos = null;
	try
	{
		// for rewrite data 
		FOS = new FOS("path");
		// for append data
		FOS = new FOS("path",true);
		byte [] arr = s.getBytes();
		fos.write(arr);		// entire array
		fos.write(arr[0]);	// one byte
		fos..write(arr,0,7);	// first 7 char
		fos.write("\n".getBytes()); // new line
	}
	catch(FileNotFoundExpection ex)
	{
		ex.printStackTree();
	}
	finally
	{
		try catch
		fos.close();
	}
}
```

* Character Stream

```java
// character stream program
public static void main(String [] args)
{
	//for rewrite
	FileWritter fw = new FileWritter("path");
	// for append
	FileWritter fw = new FileWritter("path",true);
	Syso("Enter Data");
	BufferReader br = new BufferReader(new inputStringReader(System.in));
	String s = br.readLine();
	fw.write(s);
	fw.write("\n");
	fw.write(s,0,10);
}
```

**Reading file**

```java
class FileReadingDemo
{
	p s v m(String [] args)
	{
		File f = new File("path");
		sysout("Exist: "+f.exist());
		
		if(f.exist() && f.isFile() && f.canRead())
		{
		FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
		int n;
		while((n=fr.read() != -1))
		{
		
			sysout(n)
		}
		
		}
		fr.close();
	}
	
}
```

* Reading data by Char array

```java
char [] ch = new Char[10];
int n;
while ((n=fr.read(arr)) != -1)
{
	sysout(arr);
}
```

***

***

## 8/7

#### Buffered Stream

* Buffer is pulling data from file
* Buffer is temp memory to file IO
* Loding the next data is done by buffered
* The purpose of buffered is memory IO and to avoid disk IO
* Disk IO is slower are taking time
* Same is applicable to write
* program first write data in buffered when buffered is full then it will flush the data to file
* flushing is occured when buffered is full
* Also closing the stream will flush the data
* flush() is also used to flush the data to file
* Giving the size to buffered is optional you can give with one of constructor
* Accouding to stream we need to pass object
* **Previousely we directly read/write data from hdd now here we read/write data with the help of buffered**

```java
//Syntax

BufferedReader brr = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("path"));

BufferedWriter brr = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("path"));


BufferedOutputStream bos = new BOS()


int n;
while((n=br.read()) != -1)
{
	sysout((char)n);
}
```

```java
BufferedWriter bw = new BW(new FileWriter("path"));
bw.write("Some String"); 	//Write on Buffered
bw.newLine();	// new line method
bw.write("Some String");
bw.flush();	// remaining data flush to file
bw.close();

```

#### Object IO

**Serialzation/ Deserialzation**

* Saving/writing object state in some perment media like file and DB
* Retrive object state in some perment media like file and DB
* Streams used for it is
  * ObjectOutputStream --> write object/serialization
  * ObjectInputStream --> read object/deserialization
* We are dealing with object here
* We are saving the `state` of the object in file/db
* `state` are the all instance data members
* static data members will discarted here because they are realted with class
* No methods i.e `behavior`
* Only set of all instance data members are saved
* Some instance data members may be excluded, you can use keyword `transient`
* int empid, date doj, long noOfDays, String name are the state of object
* transient is used to not save data, syntax --> `transient long noOfDays`
* Object that is getting Searialized should have serializable implemented
* Serialized interfaces are empty they dont contain any methods they are called `marker interface` it only used for marking the object for serialization
* Only Serialized objects can be searized else it will create `NotSerializableException`
* association has a
* interface is a
* In is a relation do it at the level of super class
* In has a relationship do seperately for all component
* If implementation of serialization is done for parent class then child class automatically affected
* for sealization we us `objectOutputStream` supported with `FileOutput`
* byte stream are compactable with byte stream character stream is only compactable with char stream
* for reading object from file we need `OobjectinputStream` with `FileInputStream`
* osi.readObject() is the method which read the object or return object
* then we have to do down typecast to see the data

```java
	public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
		Empolyee [] emp = new Empolyee[3];
		
		emp[0]=new Empolyee(1, "shree");
		emp[1]=new Empolyee(2, "shail");
		emp[2]=new Empolyee(3, "Vitkar");
		
		
		ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("/home/shree/Desktop/shree"));
		for(Empolyee e : emp)
		{
			oos.writeObject(e);
		}
		
		System.out.println("Serialization Done");	

	}
```

```java
// Deserialization

	public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
		ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("/home/shree/Desktop/shree"));
		
		Empolyee [] emp = new Empolyee[3];
		for (int i=0;i<emp.length;i++)
		{
			//Object o = ois.readObject();
			emp[i]=(Empolyee)ois.readObject();
		}
		
		for(int i=0;i<emp.length;i++)
		{
			System.out.println("Empolyee Name "+emp[i].getName()+"\n Empolyee ID  "+emp[i].getEmpid());
		}

	}

```

#### Collection Framework

* It gives readymade classes which have implemented a perticular data structure
* It is all collection classes will store collection of objects not premetive data types
* Collections cannot be of int value but cab be of Integer object
* Collection freamework is redesigned after 1.2 v
* It is clsses which is acting as datastructure
* Classes are bases on set of interfaces
* base interface is Collection
* there is few methods which are required in all collections like
  * add();
  * remove();
  * size();
  * iterator();
* Collection is further extended to
  * List
  * Set
  * Queue
* Set is further divided into
  * SortedSet();
* list can consist of duplicates
* set is set of unique data
* we are going to see classes in interface (list set and queue)

**List Interface**

* Duplicate elements are allowed in list
* abstractList is a class
* Two important list classes are
  * ArrayList
  * LinkedList
* ArrayList is most used collection
* ArrayList can dynamically grow and shrink and workded as array
* when there is requirment to search data then we use ArrayList
* When there is requirment to add/delete data then we use LinkedList

```java
List l = new ArrayList();
l.add("bakul");
l.add(new Person());

String s = (String)l.get(2); 	// It will genetrate class castclassexception
// we cannoct convert Person object as string

// care has to be taken at the time of adding the element

List <String> l = new ArrayList<>();
// because of <String> i can only pass/add string so there will not need of type cast
```

* is generics which will add type safty to the collection
* because of this we can oly add string no need of typecast

```java
//without using generic 

class Demo
{

	//List l = new ArrayList();	//This will generate error
	List <String> l = new ArrayList<>();
	l.add(new String("Welcome"));
	//l.add(new Date());
	//l.add(new Integer(45));
	
	//String s = (String)l.get(1);
	// String s = l.get(0);
	
	Sysout(l); //call toString print all elements
	
	l.add(2,"xyz"); //addded to index 2
	l.remove(3);	//remove element
	l.remove("xyz"); // remove by value
	
	
	// advanced loop
	for( String s : 1)
		sysout(s.toUpperCase());
}
```

## 9/7(Collections)

#### Utility Classes

* It is collection of objects
* You can add any object to collection
* Base of collection is lies on set interface
* Collections is interface has some methods add,remove..etc
* Collections is extended to List, Set and Queue
* In list duplicate are allow

#### Iterator method for ittration data from collection

\*\*\*\* // Collection upto Reversion

**Collection freame work**

* Types of collections classes
  * List
    * al
    * ll
  * set
    * hs
    * ts
  * queue
    * pq
* adding, removing, Itreating
* common algos Collections (class with static methods)
* Map key value map --> set
* lagecy classes
  * stack

***

## 10/7

#### Iterating

* We can iterate data from three ways from collections
  * Advanced for loop
  * using iterator
  * List Iterator(only for list)
* Advanced for loop

```java
set<String> str = new ArrayList<>();

for(String s : str)
{
	syso(s);
}
 
```

* using iterator
* Iterator has two methods as follow
  * has()
  * hasNext()

```java
List<String> str = new ArrayList<>();
Iterator i  = str.iterator();
while(hasNext())
{
	syso((String)next());
}
```

* ListIterator
* ListIterator has three methods as follow
  * next()
  * hasNext()
  * hasPrevious()

```java
List<String> str = new ArrayList<>();
ListIterator<String> li = str.listIterator();
while(li.hasNext())
	li.next();
	
while(li.hasPrevious())
	sysout(li.previous());
```

#### HashSet

* Hashing is the storing a data in a perticular way
* In

## 13/7

#### Multithreading

* What is thread? Compare thread process?
* why mltithread application
* thread life cycle
* creating a simple thread
* There is two different way to creating thread
  * extends Thread (Class)
  * implement runnable (Interface)
* Thread
* Specific to the task
  * run()
* control the task
  * start()
  * join()
  * Sleep()
* In runnable it has only on method that is run();

#### Create a thread

```java
//syntax

class MyThread extends Thread
{

	p v run()
	{
		//specify the task
	}
}

class ThreadApp
{

	p s v m();
	{
		Thread t = new MyThread();	//newly created state
		t.start();	 // before call run you have to call start()
		// when you call start() then it will automically call run() from MyThread class
		
		 
	
	}
}





// Implement Runnable 
class MyTask implements Runnable
{
	pv run()
	{
		//specify task
	
	}

}

class ThreadApp
{

	main()
	{
		Runnabble r = new MyTask();
		Thread t = new Thread(r);	//newly created state
		t.start();	// call run()
		
		// we are indirect calling the start by thread 
		// Runnable is always depend on thread
	}

}
```

* Runnable is always depend on thread

```java
class MyThread extends Thread
{

	public void run()	//task to be done by the thread
	{
		for(int i =1;i<=5;i++)
		{
			sysout("child Thread"+i);

			try
			{
			Thread.sleep(500);	//sleep is static method
			// we cannot handle throws exception here 
			}
			catch (InterruptedException e)
			{
				e.printStackTree();
			}

		}
	}

}


main()
{

Thread t = new MyThread();
t.start

for(int i=1;i<=5;i++)
{


}

}
```

```java
// Runnable
main()
{
	// represent task
	Runnable r = new MyTask();
	Thread t = new Thread(r);
}
```

#### Threasd Synchronization

* Because of Multiple thread we achive better performancw
* when multiple thread share common resource (object) it may lead to data inconsistancy
* Thread Sync is needed when multiple thread share common resource (Object)
* Because of every thread is giving some time so it not able to complet its task
* So 1st thread will lock object
* others process will go to waiting because object is locked
* and when 1st complete the task then it will unlocak
* Best example is ATM
* Here is the dealy of time but we are achiving here data consistency
* `Synchronised` keyword is used to locking the object
* you can use sync keyword on block of code or method
